# What is SpykeCannon_?ðŸ¤”
It's a game made for the [The Indie Tales Jam](https://itch.io/jam/indie-tales-jam)!
The jam's theme was "One Room". So we made a game where your bullets bounce off the wall and you have to use this to defeat the enemies.

# How can I play?
You can download the game build [here](https://mrcoolgandalf.itch.io/spykecannon).
You can also download the source code and compile it in the Unity Game Engine.

# What are the controls?
You can use your arrows or WASD to move the player and your spacebar or mouse to shoot!
